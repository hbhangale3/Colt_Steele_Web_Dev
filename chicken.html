    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.[3] Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising
    chickens—in comparison to mammals such as cattle or hogs—chicken meat (commonly called just "chicken") and chicken
    eggs have become prevalent in numerous cuisines.
    <p>Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, boiling, and
        roasting. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken
        is sometimes cited as being more healthy than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated
        fat.[4]</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along with the grey junglefowl first raised
        thousands of years ago in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.[6]Chicken as a meat has been depicted
        in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC.[7] Chicken was one of the most common meats available in the Middle
        Ages.[8][9] For thousands of years, a number of different kinds of chicken have been eaten across most of the
        Eastern hemisphere,[10] including capons, pullets, and hens. It was one of the basic ingredients in blancmange,
        a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.[11]</p>

    <h2>Breeding</h2>
    <p>Modern varieties of chicken such as the Cornish Cross, are bred specifically for meat production, with an
        emphasis placed on the ratio of feed to meat produced by the animal. The most common breeds of chicken consumed
        in the U.S. are Cornish and White Rock</p>
